TO DO

Spotipy does not seem to work how we want it to. Here's some other solutions:

1. Billboard R&B/Hip Hop - Top Songs
  By using Billboard instead of spotify, we get access to music from 2002
  to 2019, and we can focus on the R&B Hip Hop Genres. We would also get
  access to someone else's web scraper for the billboard hot 100, which
  we could repurpose to this.

2. Spotify Charts - Fetch from 1/1/17 to date.
  We could use spotify charts if all else fails. It has a built in download CSV
  option we could use.
